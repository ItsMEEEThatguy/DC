                 <p>Chandrasekhar, born in Lahore in 1910 during British Raj, belonged to a Tamil Brahmin family.<br> His parents, Sita Balakrishnan and Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar,provided an <br> intellectually stimulating environment.  He had siblings, including elder sisters Rajalakshmi and<br> Balaparvathi, and younger brothers and sisters. Notably, his maternal uncle was physicist<br> Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman. Chandrasekhar's education began at home, where his<br> father taught him math and physics, while his mother nurtured his curiosity.</p>

              <p> He attended Hindu High School and later Presidency College in Madras, where he wrote his first paper inspired by Arnold<br>Sommerfeld's lecture. Chandrasekhar earned his bachelor's degree in physics in 1930 and<br> secured a Government of India scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge. There, under <br>R. H. Fowler's guidance, he refined the statistical mechanics of degenerate electron gas in white<br> dwarf stars, building upon Fowler's work with relativistic corrections.</p>

            <p>During his first year at Cambridge, Chandrasekhar worked under Fowler, calculating mean opacities and<br> refining the model for limiting mass of degenerate stars. He met E. A. Milne at the<br> Royal Astronomical Society meetings and later studied opacities and stellar photospheres at Max <br>Born's institute in GÃ¶ttingen. Following Dirac's advice, he concluded his graduate studies in<br> Copenhagen, where he encountered Niels Bohr.</p>

              Chandrasekhar's legacy grew, gaining the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professorship<br> and US citizenship in 1952 and 1953. His ties to NASA's Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space<br> Research further enhanced his prominence. His residences, like 4800 Lake Shore Drive and<br> 5550 Dorchester Building, testify to his lasting impact on astrophysics.</p>

              <p>Chandrasekhar's scientific drive stemmed from a desire to unify and contribute. He sequentially<br> mastered diverse fields, including stellar structure, dynamics, radiative transfer, quantum theory,<br> and relativity. His journey spanned from the 1920s to the late 1980s, encompassing white<br> dwarfs, black holes, and gravitational waves.</p>

              <p>Chandrasekhar's exceptional student engagement spanned five decades (around <br>1930-1980), collaborating at an average age of 30.
