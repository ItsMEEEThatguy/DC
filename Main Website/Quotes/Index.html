                    <p>“The pursuit of science has often been compared to the scaling of mountains, high and <br>not so high. But who amongst us can hope, even in imagination, to scale the Everest<br> and reach its summit when the sky is blue and the air is still, and in the stillness of the air<br> survey the entire Himalayan range in the dazzling white of the snow stretching to infinity?<br> None of us can hope for a comparable vision of nature and of the universe around us.<br> But there is nothing mean or lowly in standing in the valley below and awaiting the sun to<br> rise over Kinchinjunga.”

                    <p>“In my entire scientific life, extending over forty-five years, the most shattering<br> experience has been the realization that an exact solution of Einstein's equations of<br> general relativity, discovered by the New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr, provides the<br> absolute exact representation of untold numbers of massive black holes that populate<br> the universe. This "shuddering before the beautiful," this incredible fact that a discovery<br> motivated by a search after the beautiful in mathematics should find its exact replica in<br> Nature, persuades me to say that beauty is that to which the human mind responds at its<br> deepest and most profound level.”

                        <p>“Actually, under stellar conditions matter is generally so highly ionized that, as we shall<br> see in greater detail in chapter vii, the uncertainty in the chemical compositions<br> essentially due to the uncertainty in the abundance of the two lightest elements, namely,<br> hydrogen and helium. The abundance of the lightest elements, has then to be<br> considered as a fresh parameter in the discussion. We can thus summarize by saying<br> that our fundamental problem is to seek a theoretical relation of the kind</p>
