                    <p>“The pursuit of science has often been compared to the scaling of mountains, high and <br>not so high. But who amongst us can hope, even in imagination, to scale the Everest<br> and reach its summit when the sky is blue and the air is still, and in the stillness of the air<br> survey the entire Himalayan range in the dazzling white of the snow stretching to infinity?<br> None of us can hope for a comparable vision of nature and of the universe around us.<br> But there is nothing mean or lowly in standing in the valley below and awaiting the sun to<br> rise over Kinchinjunga.”
